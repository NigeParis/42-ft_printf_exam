# 42-ft_printf EXAM
This project is pretty straight forward. It's about recoding the printf function in C, and learning how to manipulate variadic functions and it's arguments.<br>

The prototype of ft_printf() is:<br>
int ft_printf(const char *, ...);<br>

Here are the requirements:<br>
• Don’t implement the buffer management of the original printf().<br>
• Your libftprintf.a has to be created at the root of your repository.<br>
<br>
You have to implement the following conversions:<br>
• %s Prints a string (as defined by the common C convention).<br>
• %d Prints a decimal (base 10) number.<br>
• %x Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) lowercase format.<br
